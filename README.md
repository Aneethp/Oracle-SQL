Database = Group of Information
>In 1960s, High level programming language developers suggested to make a use of programming languages to manage(store and retrive)the Facts and Figure.
>In programming language there is a concept called datatypes,variables and arrays. One can make a use of it and can store facts and figures.
>People were very happy because computers do not hava a disadvantage like LEDGERS, and now they have a why to store facts and figure in the computers and they did that using the programming language.
>But as the size of facts and the figure increased, programming languages failed to manage it.
>Programming language are successfull only to manageing (Storeing and retriving) data (small volumns of facts and figures) but not database(Large volumn of facts and figure).
